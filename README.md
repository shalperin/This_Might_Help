## Phenomenology / Symptomatology / Mitigation

Hard won, but non-clinical insights on mental health and modernity. Not medical advice.

### Random noise -> Pareidolia

The apartment is going to creak as temperature changes, especially in winter. The structure expands and contracts.  I have trouble with non-rational spiritual interpretations, so interpreting that as anything other than construction physics or random noise tends to worsen the experience.

Useful tip: _Masking_:
put headphones on and music.  I like the lofi genre or study music.  
Notice that when the background noise is masked the delusional inference tends to go away.
Sometimes a banal conversation like a documentary or YouTube product demo on in the background helps.







### Did I hear you right?  Aberrant semantic completion

I _do_ have a problem with roots music that's not in English. I have some, but minimal language training, so sometimes I can only really translate every fifth or tenth sentence. Sometimes singers also mix in English, my native language.  The delusion is essentially perceiving language, content that isn't actually there.

Useful tip _native language roots music_: 
If you are in the mood for roots music but are feeling a little bit overwrought, try diasporic roots music in your native tongue.
Neutral calming music might help here too, I like classical or lo-fi. 







### Timed Coincidence -> Synchronicity
Another common source of pain is my cycling HVAC.  The fan kicks on with essentially random timing, and that can aberrantly take on salience based on coincidental alignment with a thought, or another sense.

Mitigation for musicians: _Ultra-low BPM composition and sparse improvisation_
Create a track in DAW. Set tempo to 20BPM (traditional Lo-fi is more like 60 - this is closer to ambient).
Long loop a drum beat, bassist, keyboardist..etc. (Logic's session musicians are useful here)
improvise in a sparse way over the top of that using your instrument or voice.
Let the much slower tempo have a regulating effect on mood
Going from just calm to sedated is not always unwarranted.






### Sympathetic nervous system activation and "threat detection spooling up"

Crowded chaotic room.  Little things, rational or not are making me feel unsafe.  As the brain's threat detection systems spool up (SNS, amygdala, norepinephrine, cortisol) a preverbal threat signal strengthens, and you can't talk yourself out of it.  This can be experienced as panic, dissociation, paranoia....etc.

Mitigation
medicine, consult your provider
Mindfulness can be useful if the symptoms aren't extreme.  Look for a meditation on 'reducing aversion to anxiety', 'reducing anxiety without reducing anxiety', 'anxiety as sensation in the body'
Change of environment: gracefully exit the scene.  Go somewhere calmer and quieter.  Try not to make it harder to come back and try again tomorrow.





### Rapid Fire ideation - insomnia

Ideas are coming quickly, they aren't necessarily incoherent, but the pace is disturbing and isn't allowing me to sleep.

Mitigation
sleep track (again, I like lo-fi or classical) with a sleep timer
notebook by the bedside to just get ideas out in a terse, shorthand
gently moving towards letting go of the need to capture or otherwise act on ideas.  An appreciation from the tech community that ideas aren't actually that significant might help "it's not the [fast] idea, it's the [slow, methodical] implementation that counts".
